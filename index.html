                    To my two absolute favorites, the twin pillars of my sanity and the dual beats of my heart. To look
                    at the two of you is to understand that soulmates aren't always romantic partners, sometimes, they
                    are the women who hold your hand while you navigate the chaos of existence. You are my chosen
                    family, a perfect balance of light and depth, sugar and spice, the storm and the shelter. A life
                    without you two would be a book with blank pages, a song with no melody, a world completely devoid
                    of color.

                    Moyo, my dazzling dancing queen, you are the spark that lights up every room and the gist that keeps
                    my life entertaining. You feel so deeply, loving with your whole heart and wearing your emotions
                    like the finest silk. I know you love the nice things in life, the luxury, the beauty, the shine,
                    but the truth is, you are the nicest thing I know. I know you have a man who holds your heart, and
                    he is a lucky guy, but he knows he has to share you with us. You are the fun, the rhythm, and the
                    warmth that melts even the coldest days.

                    Mutma, my brilliant revolutionary, you are the anchor and the fire combined. Your mind is a library
                    I never tire of exploring, a historian who knows where we’ve been and an activist fighting for where
                    we need to go. You see the world not just as it is, but as it could be, and your intellect is as
                    sharp as a blade. You love differently, freely, and outside the boxes the world tries to set, and
                    that authenticity makes you radiant. In a world of noise, you are the signal, the truth teller, and
                    the one who reminds me that power comes from within.

                    Together, you are the perfect symphony. One brings the party, the other brings the purpose, one
                    brings the glitter, the other brings the grit. Moyo, you make sure we never forget to dance, and
                    Mutma, you make sure we never forget to think. I am the luckiest person alive to stand between such
                    softness and such strength, to be loved by the life of the party and the leader of the movement. You
                    complete me in ways I didn't know were possible.
